The parameter server is a distributed system scaling to industry size machine
learning problems. It provides asynchronous and zero-copy key-value pair
communications between worker machines and server machines. It also supports
flexiable data consistency model, data filters, and flexiable server machine
programming.

NOTE: We are refactoring this repository in the lite branch, there is a simpler
communication interface, and application codes will be moved to other DMLC
repositories soon.
