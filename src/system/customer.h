/**
 * \brief The base class of a shared object, such as an application or shared parameters.
 *
 * Customer implements an asynchronous RPC-like interface. A
 * customer can send a request to another customer with the same ID in a remote
 * machine.
 *
 * How it works:
 *
 * The customer A at node NA can submit a request to the customer B at node NB if both A
 * and B have the same Customer::id. The request Message, contains
 * arguments specified by the protobuf class Task and additional data such as
 * (key,value) pairs. The customer B first processes this request by the
 * user-defined function ProcessRequest() if the dependency constraints in this
 * request are satisfied; and then sent back the response to A by `Reply'. Once
 * A received the process, the user-defined function `ProcessResponse' will be
 * called.
 *
 * It's an asynchronous interface. `Submit' returns immediately after the
 * message is queued in the system. There is a timestamp assigned to each
 * request for synchronization. For example, B can use it to check whether this
 * request has been processed via `WaitReceivedRequest', while A can use `Wait'
 * to wait the response from B. A can also set a callback function when the
 * response is arriving.
 *
 * Furthermore, customer A can submit a request to a node group, such as the
 * server group. There is a user-defined function `Slice' which will partition
 * the request message, mainly the (key,value) pairs, according to the key range
 * of the remote node. Each node in this group will get a part of the original
 * message.
 *
 * There are user-defined filters to encode and decode the messages
 * communicated between nodes, mainly to reduce the network overhead.
 *
