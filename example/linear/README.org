* Sample configurations to run linear method

** Data

Use the script such as =rcv1/download.sh= and =ctr/download.sh= to download data

** Run in local machine

The system can be run by either building the binary or downloading a docker images.

*by build binary*

Use the binary you compiled to run l1-regularized logistic regression:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# run block coordinate descent with 2 servers and 2 workers:
../../script/local.sh ../../build/linear 2 2 -app_file ctr/batch_l1lr.conf
# evaluate the model
../../script/local.sh ../../build/linear 0 0 -app_file ctr/eval_batch.conf
#+END_SRC

*by [[www.docker.com][docker]]*

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo ../../docker/local.sh 2 2 ctr/batch_l1lr.conf data model
#+END_SRC
